In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront for my body with the MySQL. This is totally legit not black market with absurd prices. So come on by. The app will take your order from customers and take stock from the store's inventory. 

Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.
